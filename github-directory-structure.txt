## Setup Instructions

1. Create the directory structure shown above
2. Place each file in its corresponding location:
   - `index.html` in the root directory
   - `style.css` and `responsive.css` in the `css` folder
   - `main.js` and `admin.js` in the `js` folder
   - `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md` in the root directory

3. Create the missing folders:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p css js img/security-badges screenshots
   ```

4. Add a placeholder mockup image:
   - You'll need to add your own mockup image to `img/mockup.png`
   - For now, you can use any placeholder image and rename it to `mockup.png`

5. Take a screenshot of your site once it's running and save it to `screenshots/streamshare-screenshot.png` for the README

## GitHub Setup

After organizing your files according to the structure above, follow these steps to push to GitHub:

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd path/to/streamshare

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add all your files to staging
git add .

# Commit your files
git commit -m "Initial commit for StreamShare landing page"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/streamshare.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Local Development

To test your site locally, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser:
- Double-click on the `index.html` file in your file explorer, or
- Drag and drop the `index.html` file into your browser window

For a more professional development environment, you can use a local server like Live Server in VS Code.
